**Name:** baby ROP but unexploitable
**Points:** 588
**Prompt:** I wrote a shitty HTTP server to practice some C and included an obvious "vulnerability" to let you practice some ROP. But wait, there's (to the best of my knowledge) no address leak and I trust ASLR, so it's obviously unsolvable... might as well move on to the next challenge.
